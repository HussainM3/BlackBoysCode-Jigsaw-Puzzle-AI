# BlackBoysCode-Jigsaw-Puzzle-AI
This repository is for a Jigsaw Puzzle AI that will be built for students in the Level 3 class in the Brampton Chapter of BlackBoysCode.

## Overview
The Jigsaw Puzzle AI is a project that solves jigsaw puzzles using computer vision and deep learning. The AI will be able to solve jigsaw puzzles by identifying the pieces and their correct positions. This allows the solver to be used on different jigsaw puzzle images.

## Assignment
Your main goal today is to learn how the AI solver works (as much as you can) and find a new puzzle image the solver can also solve!

Here are the steps of today's lesson:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the following commands one by one in a **new terminal** (Top left menu > Terminal > New Terminal) to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install fastdtw
```
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
```
3. Follow along each cell of the jupyter notebook file to learn how the solver works!
